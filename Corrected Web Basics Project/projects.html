               <p>As technologies evolve and polycrisis persists, historical design features associated with car culture over the last century are in transition.
                While the industry prepares for upcoming regulation change banning hexavalent chromium <a href="https://www.magnetomagazine.com/articles/proposed-eu-chrome-plating-ban-isnt-what-it-seems/">(1)</a>, customization trends in vinyl wrapping have become more prevalent over the past few years. As chrome delete and blackout kits become more popular, car manufacturers have made zero chrome models available, ranging form the <a href="https://www.kia.com/us/en/carnival-mpv?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=12918408870&utm_content=152272044666&utm_term=kia%20carnival%202023&&&&&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-omoy_yuiQMVxU5HAR05sjDsEAAYASAAEgLAY_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">Kia Telluride “X-Line” models</a>, <a href="https://www.mboffremont.com/mercedes-benz-amg-night-package-details/">Night Package</a> from Mercedes and <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/x-models/x4/sports-activity-coupe/bmw-m.html">Shadowline</a> from BMW, following Tesla’s chromeless lead.
               <br><br>To keep up with the mobility revolution, brand consultancies tasked with the rebranding of iconic American car brands tap archives to preserve brand meaning for new audiences <a href="https://www.motherdesign.com/work/cadillac/">(2)</a>.
               Regulatory change and shifting consumer mindsets have introduced new automotive allegories. Industrial designers and creative directors remix and “futurize” aesthetics while preserving historical American autmotive symbolism. In this new regulatory and demographic context skeumorphs, LED light patterns, mushroom, protein and jellyfish-sourced leatherette are all part of the new visual, sensorial and allegorical nomenclature of mobility.

               <h2>an expanded palette of metaphors</h2>
            
               <p>Frontiers - scientific, technological, geographical and intergalactic -are deeply rooted American metaphors that are in continual use even as legacy car manufacturers invest in Silicon Valley incubators to collaborate with mobile technology, ride share app developers and artificial intelligence research.
               <br><br>As the industry becomes digitalized and electrified, designers of software-driven EV are transforming the car from a gas-powered status symbol to an extended experience across devices. With a wider set of metaphors to explore, designers focus as much attention on in-cabin experience designs, digital to physical operating systems, interface and sound design as self driving technologies advance.
               <br><br>Sound designers now join industrial designers and car manufacturers to encode new sensorial cues to smooth the transition between legacy and new automotive driving experiences <a href="https://www.bmw.com/en/magazine/innovation/supercar-blondie-hans-zimmer-drive-bmw-i4.html">(3)</a>.
